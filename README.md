# Term_Project

Introduction
Brendan and the Jo(h)nathans NERF turret was the term project for the second mechatronics class at Cal Poly. The goal of this turret was to use closed-loop motor control and a thermal camera to detect a target, aim, and fire a foam dart automatically. The finished product is shown in Figure 1a.
